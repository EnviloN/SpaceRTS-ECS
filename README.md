# NI-APH Semestral Project

## About:
The player plays an infiltrator with glowing eyes (robot or cat person). The objective of the game is to infiltrate into a building with patrolling guards without being detected. The guards can detect the player in a lit environment. However, in shadows, guards can only detect the glowing eyes. The player can close the eyes in order to stay completely invisible in dark areas. On the other hand, with the eyes closed, the player loses the ability to view the environment, and only sounds are visualized. The player can freely move with the eyes closed, and there is no other than the visual limitation.

**Future ideas**: 
- The player is a thief and has to steal some objective items and then evacuate the building.
- More challenging levels contain guards that can use flashlights to view dark areas.
- There are some objective items that need to be stolen glow and make the escape harder for the player.
- There are objects in which the player can hide.
